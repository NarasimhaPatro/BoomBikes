# BoomBikes
> Objective - The objective of this project is to develop a model that can predict the demand for shared bikes offered by BoomBikes in the US market. This model will be used to:

1. **Identify significant factors:** Understand which factors from the available data significantly impact the demand for shared bikes.
2. **Predict demand:** Predict the number of bike rentals based on the identified factors. This will help BoomBikes anticipate demand fluctuations and optimize their operations.
3. **Improve business strategy:** Use the insights from the model to develop a data-driven business strategy. This could involve strategically placing docking stations, adjusting pricing based on demand forecasts, and launching targeted marketing campaigns.
4. **Understand market dynamics:** Gain insights into the overall demand patterns for shared bikes in the US market. This knowledge can be valuable when entering new markets or expanding existing services.

By achieving these objectives, BoomBikes can:

* **Increase revenue:** By understanding and meeting customer demand more effectively.
* **Reduce costs:** By optimizing resource allocation based on predicted demand.
* **Gain a competitive edge:** By offering a service that is more responsive to customer needs.

Overall, this project aims to leverage data analysis to create a more informed and successful business model for BoomBikes in the post-pandemic US market.

## Conclusions
- Enhance Verification Processes - Implement stricter verification procedures to reduce the risk associated with unverified loans. Use advanced data analytics to assess borrower credibility and enhance loan performance. By tightening our loan verification processes, we can significantly mitigate risk and improve the accuracy of our lending decisions
- Tailored Loan Products for Debt Consolidation - Develop specialized loan products for debt consolidation to cater to the primary borrowing need. Offer competitive interest rates and flexible terms to encourage refinancing with our institution. By tightening our loan verification processes, we can significantly mitigate risk and improve the accuracy of our lending decisions.
- Educational Initiatives for Borrowers - Launch financial literacy programs to help borrowers manage their debt more effectively. Provide tools and resources to aid in better financial decision-making and credit management. Financial education can empower our borrowers to make informed decisions, reducing defaults and fostering long-term customer loyalty.
- Marketing Strategies - Target marketing efforts towards stable, long-term employed individuals and homeowners, who typically present lower risk. Utilize insights from loan purposes to drive promotions and product offerings. Utilizing demographic and financial behaviour insights allows us to target our marketing more effectively, reaching the most promising potential borrowers.
